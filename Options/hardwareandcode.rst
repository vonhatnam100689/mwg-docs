Hardware and Code 
=================
When you get to the point where you 
are dealing with both hardware *and* code, 
you're really about to unleash some great 
fun and learning.  

* Understanding how physical design might
  affect the code you write
* Learning about libraries that can be 
  used to make coding easier

Here's what a Raspberry Pi 2 and
a Sense HAT look like:

With these, you can do cool things
like program your own version 
of Connect-4 -- you will need to 
consider how to check for a 
win by evaluating options as shown
in the diagram below:
